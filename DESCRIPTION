Description: This package allows you to do a single or multiple simulations of the Monty Hall game. This is a similar set up to how Let's Make A Deal does their final game with three doors with a car behind one of them and the two other doors having jokey or less valuable items. The default set up is with three doors, one with a car and the other two being goats. The package will go through a specified n iterations of the game including a built in n=100 function. The package will also return in the end whether or not the contestant won or lost.
